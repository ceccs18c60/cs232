[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mFtp[0m is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.  The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote network site.[m
[m
     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter.[m
[m
     [1m-4[0m    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.[m
[m
     [1m-6[0m    Use IPv6 only.[m
[m
     [1m-p[0m    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environments where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world back to the client machine. Requires that the ftp[m
           server support the PASV command. This is the default if invoked as [1mpftp.[0m[m
[m
     [1m-i[0m    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.[m
[m
     [1m-n[0m    Restrains [1mftp[0m from attempting “auto-login” upon initial connection.  If auto-login is enabled, [1mftp[0m will check the [4m.netrc[24m (see netrc(5)) file in the user's home directory for an entry[m
           describing an account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, [1mftp[0m will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary,[m
           prompt for a password and an account with which to login.[m
[m
     [1m-e[0m    Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled into the [1mftp[0m executable. Otherwise, does nothing.[m
[m
     [1m-g[0m    Disables file name globbing.[m
[m
     [1m-v[0m    Verbose option forces [1mftp[0m to show all responses from the remote server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.[m
[m
     [1m-d[0m    Enables debugging.[m
[m
     The client host and an optional port number with which [1mftp[0m is to communicate may be specified on the command line.  If this is done, [1mftp[0m will immediately attempt to establish a connection to an[m
     FTP server on that host; otherwise, [1mftp[0m will enter its command interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When [1mftp[0m is awaiting commands from the user the prompt ‘ftp>’ is provided to[m
     the user.  The following commands are recognized by [1mftp[0m:[m
[m
     [1m![0m [[4mcommand[24m [[4margs[24m]][m
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.[m
[m
     [1m$[0m [4mmacro-name[24m [[4margs[24m][m
                 Execute the macro [4mmacro-name[24m that was defined with the [1mmacdef[0m command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.[m
[m
     [1maccount[0m [[4mpasswd[24m][m
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system for access to resources once a login has been successfully completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be[m
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.[m
[m
     [1mappend[0m [4mlocal-file[24m [[4mremote-file[24m][m
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If [4mremote-file[24m is left unspecified, the local file name is used in naming the remote file after being altered by any [1mntrans[0m or[m
                 [1mnmap[0m setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for [1mtype[0m, [1mformat[0m, [1mmode[0m, and [1mstructure[0m.[m
[m
     [1mascii[0m       Set the file transfer [1mtype[0m to network ASCII.  This is the default type.[m
